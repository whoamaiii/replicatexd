Close view of many human hands forming a spiral vortex around a central circular eye like focal point, warm amber lighting, highly detailed skin pores and wrinkles. Intensify psychedelic effects while keeping the same composition: turquoise ornamental ink and subtle filigree geometry embedded in the skin texture, aligned to the curvature of fingers and palms; concentric mandala rings and a tunnel like iris emerging from the center with kaleidoscopic symmetry that follows the spiral perspective. Add gentle breathing deformation of the hands, slight drifting, soft glow haloes on highlights, increased saturation and contrast, crisp micro texture detail, faint motion trails at fingertips, depth deepening into the center, cinematic macro photography, dark teal background, sharp focus with natural depth of field.

Constraint: Keep geometric patterns embedded in surfaces and materials, aligned to perspective and lighting.
Constraint: Avoid floating geometry overlays, wireframe nets, and separate decals.

Base scene: A close view of many human hands arranged in a tight spiral around a central circular focal point. The skin shows fine wrinkles and pores, with turquoise ornamental markings across the hands, lit with warm amber tones against a darker background.

Critical constraints:
1. Geometric patterns and repeating structure must be embedded in surfaces and materials, not floating in space.
2. Keep geometry texture bound: follow surface perspective, texture flow, and occlusion, and respect lighting.
3. Do not add separate geometric objects, decals, or overlay planes that are not attached to scene surfaces.
4. Do not replace the scene. Keep the original environment recognizable and preserve the camera framing.
5. Avoid wireframe nets, floating lattice cages, and transparent geometry overlays that sit in front of the scene.
6. Avoid portals, void backgrounds, and cosmic space transitions unless explicitly required by scene replacement.


Structural guidance:
- Preserve surface structure and depth relationships (strength: 80%).
- Maintain depth layering and perspective (weight: 70%).
- Preserve major edges and compositional lines (weight: 75%).
- Keep faces recognizable and undistorted. No extra eyes on faces. (protection: 80%).
- Preserve hand structure and finger count. (protection: 60%).


Effect Routing:
- Apply all effects as surface-embedded textures and materials (90% adherence). Do not create floating geometry or overlay planes.
- Preserve facial identity and features. Avoid distorting faces or adding patterns to them.
- Maintain natural hand structure. Avoid distorting hands or adding extra fingers.
- Respect major edges and silhouettes. Keep compositional boundaries stable.
- Apply geometric patterns primarily to mid and far depth layers where surfaces are more stable.
- Apply distortions with depth-coherent warping. Near objects should distort more subtly than background.
- If adding hallucinatory elements, prefer background and peripheral regions over foreground subjects.
- Emphasize geometric patterns (fractals, tilings, form constants).
- Emphasize hallucinatory content (entities, transformations).
- Emphasize perceptual effects (synesthesia, time perception).
- Apply pattern_recognition_enhancement strongly, in subject and background and global regions, at near/mid depth, respecting edges.
- Apply breathing_surfaces strongly, in subject and background and global regions, at near/mid depth, respecting edges.
- Apply visual_acuity_enhancement strongly, in subject and background and global regions, at near/mid depth, respecting edges.
- Apply visual_drifting strongly, in subject and background and global regions, at near/mid depth, respecting edges.
- Apply texture_salience strongly, in subject and background and global regions, at near/mid depth, respecting edges.
