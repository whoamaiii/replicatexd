Close view of many human hands layered in a circular spiral, forming a tunnel like aperture toward the center, warm cinematic lighting, realistic skin pores and wrinkles, shallow depth of field. Subtle teal ornamental ink patterns embedded in the skin texture, aligned to the curvature of fingers and palms and consistent with perspective. Add strong psychedelic geometry as surface bound filigree that coheres into mandala rings and a spiral tunnel illusion toward a central eye like focal point, with gentle glow haloes on highlights, heightened saturation and contrast, slight breathing and drifting of the spiral structure, faint kaleidoscopic symmetry in the repeating hand forms. Keep the scene photoreal and grounded, no floating symbols detached from surfaces, no text.

Constraint: Keep geometric patterns embedded in surfaces and materials, aligned to perspective and lighting.
Constraint: Avoid floating geometry overlays, wireframe nets, and separate decals.

Base scene: A close view shows many human hands layered and arranged in a circular spiral, creating a tunnel like opening toward the center. The skin is warmly lit with visible pores and wrinkles, and faint teal ornamental markings appear across some hands. At the center there is a circular eye like focal point surrounded by intricate radial detail.

Critical constraints:
1. Geometric patterns and repeating structure must be embedded in surfaces and materials, not floating in space.
2. Keep geometry texture bound: follow surface perspective, texture flow, and occlusion, and respect lighting.
3. Do not add separate geometric objects, decals, or overlay planes that are not attached to scene surfaces.
4. Do not replace the scene. Keep the original environment recognizable and preserve the camera framing.
5. Avoid wireframe nets, floating lattice cages, and transparent geometry overlays that sit in front of the scene.
6. Avoid portals, void backgrounds, and cosmic space transitions unless explicitly required by scene replacement.


Structural guidance:
- Preserve surface structure and depth relationships (strength: 80%).
- Maintain depth layering and perspective (weight: 70%).
- Preserve major edges and compositional lines (weight: 75%).
- Keep faces recognizable and undistorted. No extra eyes on faces. (protection: 80%).
- Preserve hand structure and finger count. (protection: 60%).


Effect Routing:
- Apply all effects as surface-embedded textures and materials (90% adherence). Do not create floating geometry or overlay planes.
- Preserve facial identity and features. Avoid distorting faces or adding patterns to them.
- Maintain natural hand structure. Avoid distorting hands or adding extra fingers.
- Respect major edges and silhouettes. Keep compositional boundaries stable.
- Apply geometric patterns primarily to mid and far depth layers where surfaces are more stable.
- Apply distortions with depth-coherent warping. Near objects should distort more subtly than background.
- Emphasize geometric patterns (fractals, tilings, form constants).
- Emphasize hallucinatory content (entities, transformations).
- Emphasize perceptual effects (synesthesia, time perception).
- Apply pattern_recognition_enhancement strongly, in subject and background and global regions, at near/mid depth, respecting edges.
- Apply breathing_surfaces strongly, in subject and background and global regions, at near/mid depth, respecting edges.
- Apply visual_acuity_enhancement strongly, in subject and background and global regions, at near/mid depth, respecting edges.
- Apply visual_drifting strongly, in subject and background and global regions, at near/mid depth, respecting edges.
- Apply texture_salience strongly, in subject and background and global regions, at near/mid depth, respecting edges.
