A car side mirror reflects a winding mountain road and green hills with a partial close up of a woman’s face, the scene filled with luminous color, flowing textures, and embedded fractal spiral and mandala patterning across foliage and surfaces, glowing points of light and rainbow shimmer aligned to the terrain and mirror perspective, detailed and richly textured, softly lit twilight atmosphere

Constraint: Keep geometric patterns embedded in surfaces and materials, aligned to perspective and lighting.
Constraint: Avoid floating geometry overlays, wireframe nets, and separate decals.

Base scene: A car side mirror reflects a winding mountain road with green hills and a partial close up of a woman’s face. The scene is dimly lit with rich colors and textured foliage.

Critical constraints:
1. Geometric patterns and repeating structure must be embedded in surfaces and materials, not floating in space.
2. Keep geometry texture bound: follow surface perspective, texture flow, and occlusion, and respect lighting.
3. Do not add separate geometric objects, decals, or overlay planes that are not attached to scene surfaces.
4. Do not replace the scene. Keep the original environment recognizable and preserve the camera framing.
5. Avoid wireframe nets, floating lattice cages, and transparent geometry overlays that sit in front of the scene.
6. Avoid portals, void backgrounds, and cosmic space transitions unless explicitly required by scene replacement.


Structural guidance:
- Preserve surface structure and depth relationships (strength: 60%).
- Maintain depth layering and perspective (weight: 70%).
- Preserve major edges and compositional lines (weight: 50%).
- Keep faces recognizable and undistorted. No extra eyes on faces. (protection: 80%).
- Preserve hand structure and finger count. (protection: 60%).


Effect Routing:
- Apply all effects as surface-embedded textures and materials (90% adherence). Do not create floating geometry or overlay planes.
- Do not modify face regions. Keep facial features, identity, and expression stable. No extra eyes, distorted features, or pattern intrusion on faces.
- Preserve hand anatomy and finger count. Keep hands structurally intact.
- Apply geometric patterns primarily to mid and far depth layers where surfaces are more stable.
- Apply distortions with depth-coherent warping. Near objects should distort more subtly than background.
- Apply global color and perception shifts uniformly across the entire image.
- Apply pattern_recognition_enhancement strongly, in subject and background and global regions, at near/mid depth, respecting edges.
- Apply breathing_surfaces strongly, in subject and background and global regions, at near/mid depth, respecting edges.
- Apply visual_acuity_enhancement strongly, in subject and background and global regions, at near/mid depth, respecting edges.
- Apply visual_drifting strongly, in subject and background and global regions, at near/mid depth, respecting edges.
- Apply texture_salience strongly, in subject and background and global regions, at near/mid depth, respecting edges.
